# Multithread-Projects

## Auction Server

- Simulated an auction service in which sellers can offer items and bidders can bid on them.
- Learned how to write thread-safe code.

## CoffeeShop
- Wrote a simulation for a coffee shop with following parameters:
  - the number of customers that wish to enter the coffee shop;
  - the number of tables in the coffee shop (there can only be as many customers inside the coffee shop as there are tables - other customers must wait);
  - the number of cooks in the kitchen that fill orders;
  - the capacity of machines in the kitchen used for producing food; and
  - a flag as to whether everyone has the same order or not.
- Used non-blocking algorithms to implemnent a concurrent LinkedList class.

## Maze Runner

- Used multi-thread to improve performance of DFS, BFS algorithms.

## akka Actor

- Developped a message sending system using akka framework to count and estimate the number of vowels in a set of text files.
